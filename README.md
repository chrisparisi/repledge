Repledge

This is a full stack app designed to allow a user to see what sort of transactions may have an obvious negative externality on the planet, and recommends a donation based on their transactions to a charity that will help offset their purchases.

It uses React for the front end with Sass for styling, and Redux Toolkit for state management.

Backend uses NodeJS and Express, and the Plaid API is used to allow a user to link their bank account.

The biggest learning takeaway here was learning how Plaid API worked, and how their Link component communicates with the backend and client.

This project is very much a work in progress with many planned changes and upgrades.
