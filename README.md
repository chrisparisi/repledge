Repledge

This is a full stack app designed to allow a user to see what sort of transactions may have an obvious negative externality on the planet, and reccomends a donation based on their transactions to a charity that will help offset their purchases.

It uses React for the front end with Sass for styling, and Redux Toolkit for state management.

Backend uses NodeJSS and Express, and the Plaid API is used to allow a user to link their bank account.
